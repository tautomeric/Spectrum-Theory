# Spectrum Theory
Spectrum Theory offers a way to deal with quantized information. It can be read in the abstract
in the Spectrum Theory pdf (the accompanying LaTex file is also provided.)

#spectral.py
spectral.py allows users to create and use spectrums. Basic spectrum object can be made with the
spectrum class while overlay allows handling of overlayed spectra.

#choas.py
The catorgories class in choas is used in the spectrum class and so choas.py is in this 
repository. choas offers other uses such as random number generation and computer speed
estimation. 

#uneven_spectrum.py
uneven_spec class is a subclass of spectrum in spectral.py. Allows for nonconstant quantium by taking
a lambda as a instance variable q
